# Red Hizon's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my background, skills, projects, and contact information. Due to the numerous projects I’ve worked on, I’m currently in the process of organizing and filtering which projects to feature, so the `Projects` section is still a work in progress.

Big thanks to Ludiflex for their article, which helped shape the initial visual foundation of this site. I’ve since made extensive modifications to the content and elements to better reflect my unique personality and experience.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the information helpful as I continue to update and refine the site!
